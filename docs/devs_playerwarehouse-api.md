## Additional Notes

- **Authentication**: All endpoints require an API key. Include it in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```

- **Content-Type**: Ensure that all POST and DELETE requests include the appropriate `Content-Type` header, typically `application/json`.

- **Error Handling**: Always handle possible error responses (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found) gracefully in your application to ensure a robust user experience.

- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of any rate limits imposed by the API to avoid being throttled or blocked.

- **Data Validation**: Validate all data before sending requests to ensure it adheres to the expected schema, reducing the likelihood of errors.

- **Security**: Keep your API key secure. Do not expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
