# Survival Tutorial 

<p class="note">This page is currently work in progress. We will publish a newer Version soon.</p>


### **Foreword 👀**

Welcome to the interactive tutorial of our Minecraft Survival Server! This short introduction guide provides you with an overview of how our tutorial is structured and how you can benefit from it. Our interactive tutorial is designed to optimally prepare you for your adventure in the survival world.

You will be guided step by step through the most important features, tasks, and challenges that await you in the survival world, whether you are an experienced player or a newcomer.

### **Step 1: Ticket System 🎫**

Our ticket system is used to process player requests. If you want to submit a request, you can use the command `/ticket` directly in the chat.

Our team members are available to respond to requests, whether it is for the creation of ***plots*** or the ***application and approval of Redstone circuits***.


### **Step 2: Plots 🏡**

Players have the opportunity to request plots via our ***ticket system***, ensuring a smooth process for the allocation of land.

Additionally, ***every*** granted plot is automatically ***protected from destruction*** by other players.

If a player is ***inactive for more than 3 months***, the plot will be ***deleted***.

<p class="callout info">**You are not required to create a plot. You can also play normal survival on our server.**</p>


### **Step 3: Marketplace 🛒**

At the spawn area of the server, there is a marketplace where players can trade with various villagers and exchange resources.

You can quickly reach the marketplace and all its offers by using the command `/spawn` in the chat.


### **Step 4: Farming World 🌾**

The farming world serves as a special area where players can efficiently farm a variety of raw materials, allowing them to expand their resources independently.

To keep the gaming experience fresh and challenging, the ***farming world*** is ***reset every 30 days***, ensuring a regular update of available resources.

***Buildings*** or ***structures*** built within the ***farming world*** are automatically deleted after 30 days.

<p class="callout warning">**Please note that no regular backup is performed for the farming world. Items may be lost.**</p>


### **Step 5: Important Commands 📖**

Our survival server offers various helpful commands to enhance the gaming experience. These commands include:

1\. The command `/spawn` allows you to return directly to the spawn area without having to travel long distances.  
2\. With `/farmwelt`, you can reach the farming world, a special area for farming raw materials.  
3\. The command `/home` allows you to return to a place you previously set as your home.  
4\. If you have questions or concerns, you can use the command `/ticket` to create a support ticket.

Additionally, every player has the option to set up to two different home locations using the `/sethome` command.


### **Step 6: Use of Redstone ⚡**

The operation of farms and other structures relying on Redstone is only permitted if they have been manually approved by an active team member.

Before ***Redstone structures*** can be used on our server, they must be approved by a team member through the ticket system, which you can access using the command `/ticket`.

More information on which specific structures are allowed and how best to proceed with the approval process can be found here: (The building regulations are currently in progress).

### **Addition to the Tutorial 🛹**

Buildings must comply with the code of conduct and should not ruin the landscape panorama. We do not expect masterpieces, but please avoid dirt towers and cobble bunkers.

If these guidelines are not followed, the team reserves the right to remove such structures without compensation. More serious and/or repeated violations may result in a permanent server ban.
